**Monday:** 

  - I have run my first initial run on Augustus on the Mormon cricket and Schistocerca Gregaria genomes to try and annotate them. I chose them so I could try it on one that will be newly annotated soon and one that is very well annotated so that we can gauge the effectiveness of the software.
  
  - I have requested that they install OrthoVenn on the cluster as a visualization tool for OrthoFinder. It is currently only available as an online tool or through Docker (see more [here](https://orthovenn3.bioinfotoolkits.net/home)). Email will go out at 8am tomorrow.
  
  - Added citations to pipeline pages.
