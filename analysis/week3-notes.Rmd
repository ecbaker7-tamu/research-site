#### TOGA on Mac tower
TOGA seems to be running fine on the Mac tower still, I am attempting to run the make_lastz_chain pipeline to create chain data between *gregaria* and *piceferons* so that I can try to run TOGA on them, but the pipeline is taking an extremely long time to run. I may have to try and let it run overnight as I don't think it will finish by EOD.
