**Sunday:** I re-cloned the TOGA repository as Michael instructed but it still doesn't run correctly. I have emails scheduled to go out to him tomorrow at 8am for both my TOGA and make_lastz_chains errors.

**wednesday:** TOGA is officially running, still trying to get make_lastz_chains working to begin the Schistocerca analysis. I also ran GENESPACE on their test data and on cancellata, gregaria, nitens, and piceferons and was able to create synteny plots.

My plan for next week is to begin more of the heavier tasks like trying to run the annotation pipelines on  meconema thalassinum and locusta migratora, continuing troubleshooting for make_lastz_chains, making more sophisticated plots for the species trees, and finishing steps 6-8 on the Barkdull pipeline. This is all to set me up to run analysis on the Mormon cricket genome.
