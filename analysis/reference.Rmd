### Definitions

[Duplication, Gene - ](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Duplication) A mutation where one or more copies of a DNA segment are duplicated in reproduction.

[Homologous Genes -](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Microbiology_(Boundless)/07%3A_Microbial_Genetics/7.13%3A_Bioinformatics/7.13C%3A_Homologs_Orthologs_and_Paralogs) A type of gene that is inherited by 2 species that have a common ancestor. We can further subdivide homologous genes into orthologous and paralogous genes.

[Nucleotide - ](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/genetics-dictionary/def/nucleotide)A molecule that makes up DNA and RNA

[Orthologous Genes -](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Microbiology_(Boundless)/07%3A_Microbial_Genetics/7.13%3A_Bioinformatics/7.13C%3A_Homologs_Orthologs_and_Paralogs) Homologous genes that diverge after a speciation event, but the gene and its main function are preserved.

[Paralogous Genes - ](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Microbiology_(Boundless)/07%3A_Microbial_Genetics/7.13%3A_Bioinformatics/7.13C%3A_Homologs_Orthologs_and_Paralogs) Genes present in a particular organism that are related to each other through a gene duplication event.

[Isoform(s) -](https://elifesciences.org/articles/34477) Proteins that are similar and perform similar roles within the cell.

[RNA - ](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/RNA-Ribonucleic-Acid)Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a copy of DNA that is used to produce proteins and assists in the translation of DNA.

[Synteny -](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/synteny-inferring-ancestral-genomes-44022/) The conservation of order of blocks within the order of 2 sets of chromosomes that are being compared to one another.
