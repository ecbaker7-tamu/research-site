    This website is dedicated to the work I conduct at the Song Laboratory at the Texas A&M University Department of Entomology. Documented on this site are all of the projects I have previously or currently am working on, along with documentation of pipeline installation, error correction, and a glossary of bioinformatics terminology for quick reference.
  </p>

  There are links for almost every software and package used on this site if you wish to view the original documentation. For installation and execution, I have tried to provide robust instructions but I am limited somewhat by the operating systems I use and am familiar with (Windows OS, slurm cluster).
