  <p>This website is dedicated to the work I (Emily Baker) conduct at the Song Laboratory at the Texas A&M University Department of Entomology. Documented on this site are all of the projects I have previously or currently am working on, along with documentation of pipeline installation, error correction, and a glossary of bioinformatics terminology for quick reference. </p>
