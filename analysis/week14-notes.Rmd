## Updates{.tabset}

### make_lastz_chains / TOGA
We have given up on trying to configure make_lastz_chains on Grace and Devon is now running it on the TIGGS internal cluster. We have all *Schistocerca* genomes being aligned to the *Schistocerca Gregaria* genome.

We also now have both the Colorado and Idaho Mormon Cricket genomes available and NCBI is producing the alignment between those two.

### Orthofinder
Last week I was having trouble downloading one of the files for the Colorado Mormon cricket, turns out the file is incorrectly uploaded on the NCBI site. I have emailed the help desk about this issue.

Until then, I'm running OrthoFinder on the Idaho Mormon Cricket since that data is available.
