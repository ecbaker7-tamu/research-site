## Setting up & using R

I've began setting up and trying to work in R through creating the R markdown and workflowR packages.
I discovered that it is **necessary to have pandoc downloaded** in order to edit these files in VS Code, and add these 
files into the environment variable paths.  

## Beginning Work on Orthoptera Genomes

Julia and I will discuss later today (June 6th) what genomes we will create tables for. Processing of these genomes should begin next week.  

## Goals for next week
- Get workflowR site set up totally (theme, menus, etc.)
- Have tables finished & begin processing genomes
- Finish reading *Gene content evolution in the arthropods*
